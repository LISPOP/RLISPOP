# Introduction

In the previous section, we coded an R script step-by-step to learn about how to program in R. This was saved as an `.R` file. But look at the directory you are in, in the bottom right pane of the RStudio cloud window. 

You will see your `.R` script that you saved yesterday, but also the HTML file that is the guide for the script *and* an `.rmD` file that has the same prefix `introduction_to_R.Rmd` as the HTML file. 
```{r files, echo=F}
include_graphics(path="images/files.png")
```

You can open that file up by selecting `File > Open` and take a peek. 

# R Markdown

[Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) is *really* useful. It's a *very* lightweight scripting language that lets you focus on writing rather than on writing and formatting (e.g. selecting text, formatting it, bolding it, etc. etc. ). 

With just a few very basic commands in a markdown document, you can produce all kinds of documents with proper formatting: e.g. HTML, PDFs, Word, etc.

`RMarkdown` is a flavor of `Markdown` that lets you integrate R code, and its results, into a `Markdown` document and then quickly convert that into all kinds of useful documents. 

*I will be using RMarkdown to produce the HTML documents as guides for the class.* I probably will ask you to submit assignments in the form of RMarkdown documents, so it will be useful to learn how to use it. 


## Making it work

An `Rmarkdown` document starts with a header section, like the one in this file that has specified fields for author, title, date, etc. Those are the main ones. You can also specify what 

For now, open up a new `RMarkdown` document in the YAML header and set the following fields: 

1. author to be your name
2. title, pick a title, 
3. pick output to be an HTML document. 
4. date

Copy the formatting form this document into your own. 

Then, below that, just start writing some text. 

To `compile` the R Markdown document. cliock on the `knit` button. 

You can italicize text like this. *Hi there! NIce to meet you!* 

You can boldface text like this, **Nice to meet you too!**

You an set a blockquote like this: 

> These are some very fancy words. 

You can also embed a clickable URL like this, to the [Globe and Mail](http://www.globeandmail.com)

## Embedding R Code 

Most importantly you can embed R code write into the RMarkdown document with `code chunks`. 

The keyboard shortcut is OPT-CMD-I on a Mac and CTL-ALT-I on a PC. 

For each code cunk you should give it a label, after the r. 

And then you just write the R code you want. 

```{r chunk1}
print("hello world")
```

## Executing R Code chunks

There are separate shortcuts for executing R code chunks in a RMarkdown document. 

1. **Line-By-Line** You can execute a single line of R code with `CMD-Return` on a Mac or `CTL-Enter` on a PC. 

2. **Chunk-by-Chunk** Some chunks will have multiple lines of code. You can execute a whole code chunk with `Shift-CMD-Return` on a Mac or 
In the same way as in regular R, you can store the results with the `<` operator. 

3. **Top-to-Cursor-Chunk** You can also execute chunks from the top to the cursor (current chunk) with Shift-OPT-CMD-P

```{r chunk2}
output<-print("hello world")
```

And then you can call it later.


```{r chunk3}
output
```

# RMarkdown templates 

When you select `File > New File > RMarkdown` you will get a template that will rock and roll pretty much right away. 

# Changing output

To really show you the power of this, watch what happens when you set different outputs. You can even specify different types of files to produce. 

Try changing the `output:` field to things in this [list](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/output-formats.html).
